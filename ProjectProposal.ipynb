Sharks can detect splashing easily and perceive color contrasts well; therefore, since surfing causes a significant amount of splashing and requires large boards, which are often brightly colored, it is likely that surfing is the most common activity that has led to shark attacks. Sharks are also known to feed at night, so we believe that most shark attacks occur either early in the morning or right after the sun sets."

    "Last year, there was a total of 155 recorded global incidents involving shark-human interaction, 88 of which were classified as “unprovoked.” Unprovoked shark attacks are defined as those that are not initiated by humans touching sharks or actively encroaching upon shark territory. Out of these 88 unprovoked attacks, 31 took place in Florida. Records indicate that 59% of the victims were surfing or doing some sort of board sport at the time of attack, whereas 22% were swimming or wading. The remaining 19% was made up of other shallow water activities, scuba diving, body surfing, and snorkeling [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although these statistics are specific to incidents that took place in Florida, it is likely that surfing and board sports remain the most common activity performed during the time of a shark attack when global data is taken into account. Sharks are known to detect excessive splashing easily since splashing mimics “the movements of injured or disoriented prey fish and animals” [2]. Therefore, even though sharks are not inclined to eat humans, water activities that require splashing, like surfing, can attract attention from sharks and result in a shark mistaking a human for injured prey. Sharks can also perceive color contrasts well, so bright colored objects, such as surfboards or clothing, could potentially attract a shark and lead to an attack [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of shark attacks is relatively low compared to the amount of people that partake in water activities; however, these attacks are still responsible for approximately five to fifteen fatalities each year. By determining the most common activity performed during a shark attack incident and taking the time of attack into account, we will be able to determine what type of activity to avoid during specific times of the day in order to decrease the likelihood of a shark attack. Knowing this information would lead to safer practices involving water activities.\n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences): In order to get the most accurate data, we will drop all rows with missing data, all data obtained before 1950, and all rows containing activities that are uncommon or potential outliers. We plan to drop data before 1950 since some of it goes as far back as “70 A.D.,” and we do not believe that these entries are as accurate as the attacks recorded in the last 70 years. We also plan to drop the uncommon activities because we are focusing on the activity that makes it most likely for someone to be attacked.\n",

    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs): We will be using Pandas to create histograms of the different activities that lead up to shark attacks and Numpy to drop the missing data we find. We will group the data based on activities such as swimming, surfing, and kayaking. Once the activities are grouped, we will count how many of these activities occurred and plot them in a histogram. After determining what activity is the most common in shark attacks, we will drop times where shark attacks are very rare, such as late at night. Then, we will group the times of attack into early morning (4:00am to 7:00am), day time (7:00am to 7:00pm), and night time (7:00pm to 10:00pm) and count them to see if there is a specific time when attacks occur most frequently. We will also try to look at location and group the attacks by country, and then create a visual with a world map showing where people were injured.\n",

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, we could help lower the amount of shark attacks and consequently help amend the negative stigma surrounding sharks. If we can pinpoint what activity is most likely to attract a shark, we can warn people not to do that in areas where sharks are known to pass through. Also, people have this idea that sharks purposefully hunt humans and this is only reinforced when someone is attacked. However, sharks often only bite people when they mistake them for their normal prey. If the amount of shark attacks can be lowered, even though there are not a significant amount of attacks now, we can help protect these animals. Sharks are hunted for their fins, for fun, and sometimes to make an area \"safer\". There would be outrage if people hunted dolphins. And although dolphins are not known for attacking people, sharks deserve the same amount of protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our hypotheses are incorrect, we would most likely still be able to identify an activity that leads to attacks. As stated above, this would be beneficial to humans and sharks alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem we may encounter is that there are other factors that cause sharks to attack. There is proof that sharks are drawn to shiny materials (such as necklaces and other jewelry). Similarly, people that are attacked while fishing and spearfishing will likely attract sharks because of the blood from fish they are trying to catch, not because of their movements in or around the water. Finally, there is a larger chance that someone surfing will accidentally cut themselves on their board than someone cutting themselves while swimming. All of these factors could contribute to shark attacks, but we want to focus on the activity itself that could attract sharks, not other circumstances.\n"
