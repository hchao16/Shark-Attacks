Great work and interesting subject ! You did good research that was relevant to your subject.
I simply displaying numbers is not a very engaging or interesting way to convey your data. Using 
packages such as matplotlib do display the data (as a histogram for example) will make your data 
easier to display, share and understand. 15% of your grade is based on data visualization. 
However, I counted the fact that you wanted to display a map of the attacks so you didn't lose any points.

Please don't forget that you will be graded on what you did and the amount of effort you put into your 
project. Simply saying the % of attacks per activity (especially since it pretty much all given in one 
dataset) might not be enough. Please think about how you could expand this idea to get more out of it.
